# Getting Started
Getting started with open-source may appear a very challenging and overwhelming task at first, but it is, in fact, a fun and rewarding experience.

# Community led Collaboration
Gaining valuable skills employers are always seeking, by:
- **Communicating and collaborating** in a team
- **Managing Github and source control** to understand why branching is important along with other key github skills.
- **Learning new stacks and technologies**, providing the opportunity to jump into something new

You will also gain project experience and eventually some portfolio material, which you could both list on your Resume/CV. In addition, you will build out your commit history (The green tiny squares on your Github profile), which employers love! But more importantly - you will learn to work in teams.

# Join an existing Project or create a new Project
## Option 1: Join a project
Joining a project is pretty simple, check out all our [project](https://github.com/protocode-community) repos, read the project README in its root directory as it will guide you on how to get started.
## Option 2: Create a project
If you think you have a new and exciting project or idea the community would love to get involved in, here is the process for getting it listed:
- Reach out to a member of the Staff on our Discord server, with a detailed project brief
- Staff will consider if the project is something that would work well with the community
- A Repository will be created and the project will be announced in #projects channel in our Discord server and featured during upcoming announcements
- If the project evolve into something bigger, we may need to assign extra members, actively maintaining the project for a bigger team
### **Rules**
- The project repo and discussion channels, will be hosted under the protocode Github organization/Discord Server
- The project must use the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

## Current Projects
You can view all our projects [here](https://github.com/protocode-community) or you can view the specific #current-projects channel in our Discord.

## Why would I want to contribute?
Here, practicing would be our primary objective, but there are many more pragmatic reasons for contributing to open source projects:

   - To add a new feature / improvement to a project; or to fix an issue with a project.
   - To practice/learn a particular programming language or technology which you are interested in.
   - To build your online presence â€“ highlighting open source contributions relevant to the job makes your resume stand out from the rest.

## Ways to contribute to Projects

  - **Test:**  Start with testing the code for any bugs, if found raise an issue about it. (Always check first if someone has already raised an issue for the same.)
  - **Suggest features:** Look for possible improvements and provide suggestions in the comment section.
  - **Design:** Considering the fact that practice is the main objective, try to make little changes on your forked repository and make a pull-request about it. *Commit often and provide appropriate messages to your commits.*
  - **Improve** documentation of the various projects.
